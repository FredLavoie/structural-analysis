# Structural-analysis-program
A 2-dimensional structural analysis program (frames and trusses) written in Fortran95.

The user creates a input file containing the structural geometry and loading (UDL, point loads, moments).
Once the program is run, it creates an output file which presents the resulting internal forces of the structure
including support reactions.
